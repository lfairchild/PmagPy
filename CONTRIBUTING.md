# Contributing

## Ways to contribute

As an open-source, community project, we welcome improvements and feedback!  There are two main ways to contribute to the PmagPy project.

1. If you want to report a bug or request a new feature, you can click here to create a [Github issue](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/issues).  If you are reporting a bug, please provide as much detail as possible about how you discovered the bug.  For a full explanation of how to create a new issue, and what information to include, see [Github documentation](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing).

2. If you want to add a new feature yourself or fix a bug yourself, that's great too.  The process for adding a feature looks like this: fork the PmagPy repository, create a branch for your feature or bugfix, make some changes, and then submit a pull request.  Don't worry if you don't know how to do all of those steps!  If you aren't familiar with git, Github, or the details of this process, you will find this short [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) helpful.  If you're still stuck after that but want to contribute, you can create a [Github issue](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/issues) and we will help get you sorted.  Depending on what kind of contribution you are making, you may also want to add some tests.  See our [testing README](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/pmagpy_tests/README.md) for details on making and running PmagPy tests.

If you will be making significant contributions via git, we have some additional guidelines for [good git protocols](#git-protocols).

## Style guidelines

Good code must be readable.  To that end, we request that contributors try to write code that can be understood by others!  One way to do this is by adhering to reasonable style guidelines.  For more information about standard Python style guidelines, see [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).


## Testing guidelines

For information about writing and running tests, see the [testing README](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/pmagpy_tests/README.md).


## Directory structure

Next we have a breakdown of how the PmagPy repository is structured.  In some cases, we have included relevant Jupyter notebooks so that you can get an interactive demonstration of how some these pieces of code work.

### Key directories

#### pmagpy
The `pmagpy` directory contains all the low-level functionality that the PmagPy project is built on. pmag.py and ipmag.py contain many functions that can be used in Jupyter notebooks or for building up more complex programs and GUIs.  Other important modules in the `pmagpy` directory:
  - a plotting library -- pmagplotlib.py
  - a utility for building up MagIC contributions -- contribution\_builder.py
  - modules for interfacing with the data models (controlled\_vocabularies2.py, controlled\_vocabularies3.py, and data\_model3.py), as well as a full backup of the 2.5 and 3.0. data model (in the `data_model` subdirectory).

To see a notebook with examples of how to use pmag.py and ipmag.py, see the [PmagPy notebook](http://pmagpy.github.io/PmagPy.html).

To actually _run_ that notebook, see this [Cookbook section](https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#notebook_quickstart) on how to get the notebook up and running.


#### SPD
The `SPD` directory contains a program to calculate statistics using Greig Paterson's [standard paleointensity definitions](https://earthref.org/PmagPy/SPD/home.html).

#### programs
The `programs` directory contains executable programs that are installed as part of the pmagpy-cli package and can be run on the command-line.

To see a notebook with examples of how to run most of the command-line programs, see the [PmagPy notebook](http://pmagpy.github.io/PmagPy.html).

To actually run these notebooks, see this [Cookbook section](https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#notebook_quickstart) on how to get notebooks up and running.

#### dialogs
The `dialogs` directory contains GUI components that are used to build the graphical elements of the PmagPy GUIs.

#### data_files
`data_files` contains example files used in testing and in [Cookbook](https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/) examples.

#### pmag_env
`pmag_env` is a module that sets the backend for plotting as either TKAgg (for non-wxPython programs) or WXAgg (for wxPython programs).

#### locator
`locator` is a module that finds the directory where PmagPy is installed.  __Please__ use caution in modifying this module!  You can break a lot of things.


### Less key directories

- `help_files` contains html help that is used in the GUIs.

- `setup_scripts` contains scripts that are used in created standalone releases of the GUIs for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

- `bin` contains some scripts that are used in creating the Anaconda part of a pip release.

- `build`, `dist`, `pmagpy.egg_info` and `pmagpy_cli.egg_info` are not in the main Github repo, however they may be created automatically when making a pip release.  You should not need to interact directly with any of them.

- `uninstall_Mac_OSX.app` is an executable that allows users who installed PmagPy pre-pip to uninstall it completely.  This prevents possible conflicts between old and new versions of PmagPy.

Here is a visual representation of the directory structure:

```
├── bin
├── build
├── data_files
│   └── notebooks
├── dialogs
│   └── help_files
├── dist
├── help_files
├── locator
├── pmag_env
├── pmagpy
│   ├── data_model
│   └── mapping
├── pmagpy.egg-info
├── pmagpy_cli.egg-info
├── pmagpy_tests
├── programs
│   ├── deprecated
├── setup_scripts
└── uninstall_Mac_OSX.app
```


## Git protocols

For an open source project with multiple contributors, it is especially important for changes to be well and clearly documented.  Your reasoning for a certain change may be clear to you, but might need a little extra explanation for someone else.  Here are some basic guidelines to keep in mind.

- Commits should have descriptive names that briefly explain what was done and why.  "Edited file1.py" is a bad commit name!

- If your commit directly fixes [Github issue](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/issues) 100, it is useful to include "Fixes #100" in the text of the commit.  This syntax both closes the issue and links the issue to the commit for future reference.   However, commit names should always include more detail that just “Fixes #100” - additional context means that the commit message can stand alone.

- Commits should deal with one concern at a time — spanning multiple files is fine, but commits with many unrelated changes are confusing and should be broken up. This makes it easier for someone else to understand what happened, and if something broke in a particular commit it is easier to track it down if the changes are more isolated.

- If you are making a large change that will take multiple commits to implement, it is best to start a feature/fix branch.  Once the feature or fix is done, the changes can be merged into master without breaking core functionality in the meantime.

- Here is a nifty article with some fun [Github keyboard shortcuts](https://help.github.com/articles/using-keyboard-shortcuts/) to let you navigate around Github quickly and easily.

If you are left with any questions about git and Github best practices, go ahead and make a new [Github issue](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/issues) and we will try to get it worked out!

## Compile and Release Guide

We try to make new releases of PmagPy several times per year.

A new release includes: updated pip packages (pmagpy & pmagpy-cli), and updated standalone GUIs (for Windows, Mac, and Linux).

- Make sure you are set up with PyPI.  You must have a PyPI account and be added as an Owner or Maintainer of pmagpy and pmagpy-cli.  You will need to install twine using `pip install twine`.  You will also need to create a .pypirc file in your home directory (see [sample .pypirc file](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/example_pypirc)).

- Make sure all tests are passing and all new features are working.  You can check [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/PmagPy/PmagPy) for the test history.

- Run `git clean -f` in the repo (will remove any unneeded files)

- These are the steps to make a new pip release for pmagpy and pmagpy-cli:

    + First, increment the version number pmagpy/version.py.  PYPI will reject a duplicate version number, so you need to update version.py each time.  Release numbers are in the form of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, and each release number should be higher than the one before it.  More on semantic versioning can be found [here](http://semver.org).  The pip release and the standalones should all use the same release number!

    + From the PmagPy directory, use the following command to build a new distribution of pmagpy, upload it to PYPI, and upgrade locally:

    `rm -rf build dist && python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && twine upload dist/*`

    + To install that new release:  `pip install pmagpy --upgrade --no-deps`

    + To make a *test* release, use a slightly different command from the PmagPy directory, which will: build a new distribution of pmagpy, upload it to the test site (will not overwrite the version people can download), and upgrade locally:

    `rm -rf build dist && python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && twine upload dist/* -r testpypi`

    + To install the test release: `pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi pmagpy --upgrade --no-deps`

    + To build pmagpy-cli, you can use the same two commands above, but replacing "setup.py" with "command\_line\_setup.py".

    + A few notes on the whole thing:  first of all, testing the pip install locally doesn't work very well (i.e., `python setup.py install` or `python setup.py test`), because it doesn’t deal correctly with the required data files.  Whenever testing a new pip distribution, it is best to upload to test\_PYPI instead, even though it takes a minute or so to do.  Second, we are using twine for uploading to real PYPI but not to upload to test PYPI.  Using twine is recommended because it transfers the package data in a more secure way, but it doesn't currently work with test_PYPI.

    + This article has some more good information about uploading to PYPI, etc.: [clearest but slightly out of date](https://tom-christie.github.io/articles/pypi/), [official documentation](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/), [how to use testpypi](https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/).

- Create standalone executables.  The process is different for each platform, and details are in the [standalones README](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/tree/master/setup_scripts).
